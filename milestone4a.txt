Understanding how to do Milestone4A

- Define DAOs as interface
- Modify service class to access daos

The first problem to solve is defining the dao interface

Starting with UserDao

actually lets start with register.
What needs to be added to user table after I register?
	- first name, last name, imageUrl, userAlias, password
Where should I interact with data base when I register?
	- I think I need to add the user after register in the user service
	  in the server.
How should that interaction happen?
	- Instead of directily using your model classes with DynamoDB you 
	  need to build DTO classes that only store data. This is also where
	  you will put your dynamoDB classes.

    	  implementation("software.amazon.awssdk:dynamodb-enhanced")
